# devember17
Repository to hold code for the Devember challenge 2017.

## Day 1

### Sudoku Checker

Program to check whether a given sudoku puzzle is valid and print a sudoku in terminal.

## Day 2

### Outnumbered

For the Manchester Games Jam in conjunction with the Ludum Dare games jam I spent the first day working on my original game 'Outnumbered'.

The game was built in Javascript using p5.js as a renderer, and a custom physics engine.

## Day 3

### Recursive flood fill

A recursive flood fill algorithm that takes some image data and does a flood fill on given pixels.

## Day 4

### Recursive maths algorithms

Implemented functions to calculate the sum of numbers leading up to n, factorial of n, multiplication of m by n and n squared, using recursive functions.

## Day 5

### Bouncing ball

A simple bouncing ball drawn using turtle. Very basic implementation of gravity and range checks for position of the ball.

## Day 6

### Rotating rectangle

Simple program to rotate the points of a square based on some angle a in degrees.

## Day 7

### Snow globe

Create a simple snow flurry in turtle. The code isn't great but it looks nice when it's running!

## Day 8

### Outnumbered

Some minor updates to the outnumbered game.

## Day 9

### Outnumbered

Major overhaul of the outnumbered game. Added a difficulty progression, levels, second enemy style and teleport ability.

## Day 11

### Outnumbered

Introduced two new levels and changed the music. Some minor changes to level 2. Started working on boss battle though this is yet to see light of day.

## Day 12

### Outnumbered

Yet another day on Outnumbered. Spent some time working on the existing gameplay elements and drastically improved the homing rockets.

## Day 13/14

### Best fit resistance calculator

Finally something different. Spent today with an old friend and he gave me an interesting challenge that he has been working on.

This would be best suited to an arduino but I said I would design a prototype of the algorithm using python.

Essentially, rather than using a variable resistor, let's imagine using a number of resistors in paralell, hooked up to the output pins of an Arduino. 10 resistors to be precise.

Given an input target resistance rT, I'm going to design an algorithm that calculates rC (combinational resistance) where:

* rC is created by switching on a number of the resistors in parallel
* The given value of rC is the closest possible resistance to rT, given the input resistors

This took me quite a while to get working as I was attempting an iterative solution. When I switched to using a recursive solution it was much easier.

## Day 15

### As the pendulum swings

Create a basic swinging pendulum using Turtle in python. Not the best implementation ever but kind of works with given values.

## Day 16

### Growing shape

A simple program that makes a shape grow by increasing the number of sides over time.

## Day 17

### Collage creator

Generate a completely random collage from coloured circles.

## Day 18

### Snake game

Slightly off topic today with a snake game built with p5.js. The basic controls are working and the grid is drawing, tomorrow I will finish the gameplay elements.

## Day 19

### Snake game

Add game logic and make some minor improvements to game style.

## Day 20

### Snake game

Made snake Object Oriented - planning forward for introduction of multiple snakes. Battle snakes?
