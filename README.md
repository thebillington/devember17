# devember17
Repository to hold code for the Devember challenge 2017.

## Day 1

### Sudoku Checker

Program to check whether a given sudoku puzzle is valid and print a sudoku in terminal.

## Day 2

### Outnumbered

For the Manchester Games Jam in conjunction with the Ludum Dare games jam I spent the first day working on my original game 'Outnumbered'.

The game was built in Javascript using p5.js as a renderer, and a custom physics engine.

A recursive flood fill algorithm that takes some image data and does a flood fill on given pixels.

### Recursive maths algorithms

Implemented functions to calculate the sum of numbers leading up to n, factorial of n, multiplication of m by n and n squared, using recursive functions.

## Day 5

A simple bouncing ball drawn using turtle. Very basic implementation of gravity and range checks for position of the ball.

## Day 6
