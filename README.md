Repository to hold code for the Devember challenge 2017.

## Day 1

### Sudoku Checker

Program to check whether a given sudoku puzzle is valid and print a sudkou in terminal.

## Day 2

### Outnumbered

For the Manchester Games Jam in conjunction with the Ludum Dare games jam I spent the first day working on my original game 'Outnumbered'.

The game was built in Javascript using p5.js as a renderer, and a custom physics engine.
