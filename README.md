Program to check whether a given sudoku puzzle is valid and print a sudoku in terminal.

## Day 2

For the Manchester Games Jam in conjunction with the Ludum Dare games jam I spent the first day working on my original game 'Outnumbered'.

The game was built in Javascript using p5.js as a renderer, and a custom physics engine.
